    "## SQL Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a table in a database, you need to define column names and the data type of the content that will reside in those columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data type tells the database management system such as MySQL, how to interpret the value of the column. \n",
    "\n",
    "It defines what value the column can hold: integer, character, money, date and time, binary, and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "The most used data types are numeric, string, and date and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric data types\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric data types is the generic term used for all specific data types that let a column store data as numbers in the database. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two most common numeric data types used in databases are the \n",
    "- integer data type (`int`), and \n",
    "- the decimal data type (`decimal`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### String data types\n",
    "\n",
    "- This data type used to store data that contains a mix of character types.\n",
    "- This includes alphabet characters, numeric characters, and special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two most common string data types used in databases are\n",
    "\n",
    "- `CHAR` - characters of fixed length (***meaning the given length of the characters is predetermined. It can't be changed after declaration***)\n",
    "\n",
    "Column attributes are defined as `CHAR` followed by a character length in parentheses. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `CHAR(50)` means that a column only permits 50 characters of space in each field. \n",
    "\n",
    "***`CHAR` is the best option if you've predefined size of character that you want to maintain.***\n",
    "\n",
    "> NB: `CHAR` is used usually for columns with fixed length of characters (maximum 255 characters)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `VARCHAR` - stands for variable characters of variable length (meaning the length can be changed)\n",
    "\n",
    "`VARCHAR` are often used when you're not sure how many characters might be inserted in the column field. You can type `VARCHAR(50)` in SQL to allow for any input up to maximum of 50 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `TINYTEXT` - used to define columns that require less than 255 characters, like short paragraphs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- `TEXT` - used to define columns of less than 65,000 characters, like an article. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `MEDIUMTEXT` - used to defined columns of 16.7 million characters. For example, the text of a book. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `LONGTEXT` - stores up to four gigabytes of text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Date and Time Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "- `DATE` - Format: YYYY-MM-DD\n",
    "- `TIME` - Format: hh:mm:ss\n",
    "- `DATETIME` - Format: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss"

    "## Default values\n",
    "\n",
    "Database constraints are used to limit the type of data that can be stored in a table. \n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that all data inserted into the table is accurate and reliable. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the database dictates a violation between the constraint and the data operations, then it aborts these operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a violation might be an attempt to insert or upload invalid data to a table. \n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints can be column level where the rule applies to a specific column. They can also be applied at table level.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Two of the most used database constraints include `NOT NULL`, a method of preventing empty value fields, and `DEFAULT`, a method of assigning default values.***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `NOT NULL` SQL constraint is used to ensure the data fields are always completed and never left blank.  A `NOT NULL` SQL statement begins with the creation of a basic table in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "`CREATE TABLE table_name ( \n",
    "column_one data_type NOT NULL, \n",
    "column_two data_type NOT NULL,\n",
    ") ;`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `DEFAULT` constraints sets a default value for a column of no value is specified. This means that if no data is entered for a specific field within a column, then the table will automatically insert a default value instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
