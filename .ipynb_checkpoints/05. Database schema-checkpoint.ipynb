    "## Database schema\n",
    "\n",
    "The general meaning of a schema is that it's an organization or grouping of information and the relationships among them. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of a MySQL database,a schema is a ***blueprint*** of the logical layout of a database, outlining how data is organized and structured. It describes various objects within the database, such as tables, columns, views, indexes, and stored procedures. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of it as the skeleton, providing the framework and platform for how the various data elements relate and work together. \n",
    "\n",
    "***(in simple terms it is the plan of how a database is built/the logical view of the entire database)***\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: a schema does not actually contain data\n",
    "\n",
    "It defines the structure of a database and outlines the tables and fields, including the relationships between them, and other data elements necessary to accurately access and update information stored within.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a SQL database schema is a music database with artists, albums, and genres, all stored in separate tables. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "***The first step in designing a database system is designing the schema or structure of the database.***\n",
    "\n",
    "Before anyone can use a database to store and manipulate data, the database schema must first be designed. This process of database schema design is also known as ***data modeling***.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, the database schema is designed by database designers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the designers have provided the database schema, the developers can understand how the data should be stored by the application that they are implementing.\n",
    "\n",

    "     height= \"400px\"\n",
    "width= \"720px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "NB :the schema is not the diagram itself, the schema is the collection of rules and relationships for this database’s data that are depicted in the diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Conceptual*** : \n",
    "\n",
    "A conceptual schema is like a big-picture blueprint of a database. It doesn't get into details like specific tables or columns; instead, it shows the key ideas and how they connect. \n",
    "\n",
    "Its purpose is to give users a clear view of how data is organized and related in a database, helping them spot issues and plan for more detailed designs. Developers can use it as a starting point for creating specific database structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Logical schema***: \n",
    "\n",
    "A logical schema is like a detailed plan for a database, sitting between the big-picture idea (conceptual) and the actual setup (physical). It includes specific things like tables and columns, showing how data is organized and connected. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of a logical schema is to make sure data is well-organized and stored efficiently. It's helpful for spotting problems early and is especially useful for developers to understand how data is structured. They can use it as a foundation for creating the exact database setup they need.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Physical schema***: \n",
    "\n",
    "A physical schema is like the detailed blueprint for how data is stored in a database system. It gets down to the nitty-gritty, specifying things like tables, columns, and how data is actually saved on the computer. It also includes details like where data is stored, whether it's in a cloud system or somewhere else, and any rules about how data is managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of a physical schema is to make sure data is stored in the most efficient way possible. It helps database developers decide where to put data and how to organize it so that it's easy to work with. It also helps them catch problems before they happen. So, having a clear physical schema ensures data is stored well and can be easily found when needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why are database schemas important?\n",
    "\n",
    "A database schema helps database engineers to organize data into well-defined tables with relevant attributes in them. It also shows the interrelationships between tables and depicts the data types that each column must have. A well-designed database schema makes life easier for database engineers as well as developers. It helps to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maintain a clean set of data in the database related to an application. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid reverse-engineering of the underlying data model from time to time. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Write efficient queries to retrieve data for reporting purposes, analytics and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, it prevents you from ending up with a database design that requires a database engineer to do a lot of reverse-engineering down the line, wasting time and effort that leads to increased costs for organizations."

    "## Building a schema\n",
    "\n",
    "A schema consists of what’s known as schema objects. Schema objects could be things like tables, columns and relationships, at a minimum. Data types, views, stored procedures, primary keys and foreign keys are also schema objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, a database schema consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- all the important data pertaining to a given scenario and their relationships, \n",
    "\n",
    "- unique keys for all entries and database objects, \n",
    "\n",

    "## Entity relationship diagrams (ERD)\n",
    "\n",
    "An Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram is a type of flowchart that illustrates how “entities” such as people, objects or concepts relate to each other within a system. \n",
    "\n",
    "The use of entity relationship diagrams helps to provide the big picture of your database. It also ensures the data requirements and operations are well defined and documented in your project. In addition, the ER-D represents a blueprint that guides database developers through the implementation of the actual database in a relevant database management system such as Oracle and MySQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of an ER diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Entity : \n",
    "\n",
    "A definable thing such as a person, object, concept or event that can have data stored about it. Think of entities as nouns. Examples: a customer, student, car or product. It is represented as rectangle in an ER diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Entity type: \n",
    "\n",
    "A group of definable things, such as students or athletes, whereas the entity represents a specific instance or individual belonging to an entity type such as student or athlete. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Entity set: \n",
    "\n",
    "Same as an entity type, but defined at a particular point in time, such as students enrolled in a class on the first day. Other examples: Customers who purchased last month, cars currently registered in Florida.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attribute : \n",
    "\n",
    "A property or characteristic of an entity. It is represented as Oval in an ER diagram. \n",
    "\n",
    "Types of attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Key attribute : A key attribute can uniquely identify an entity from an entity set.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Composite attribute : An attribute that is a combination of other attributes is known as composite attribute. For example, In student entity, the student name is a composite of First Name and Last Name. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Multivalued attribute : An attribute that can hold multiple values is known as multivalued attribute. It is represented with double ovals in an ER Diagram. For example – A person can have more than one phone numbers so the phone number attribute is multivalued.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Derived attribute : A derived attribute is one whose value is derived from another attribute. It is represented by dashed oval in an ER Diagram. For example – Person age can be derived from another attribute (Date of birth).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "#### Relationship: \n",
    "\n",
    "How entities act upon each other or are associated with each other. Think of relationships as verbs. For example, the named student might register for a course. The two entities would be the student and the course, and the relationship depicted is the act of enrolling, connecting the two entities in that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One to One :  When a single instance of an entity is associated with a single instance of another entity then it is called one to one relationship. For example, a person has only one passport and a passport is given to one person.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One to Many : When a single instance of an entity is associated with more than one instances of another entity then it is called one to many relationship. For example a single teacher can teach many courses, and not the other way.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many to One : When more than one instances of an entity is associated with a single instance of another entity then it is called many to one relationship. For example – many students can study in a single college but a student cannot study in many colleges at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many to Many : When more than one instances of an entity is associated with more than one instances of another entity then it is called many to many relationship. For example, a student can be assigned to many projects and a project can be assigned to many students.\n",

    "## Data normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization is the process of efficiently organizing data in a database. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two goals of the normalization process: \n",
    "***eliminating redundant data*** (for example, storing the same data in more than one table) and ensuring data dependencies make sense (only storing related data in a table). \n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these a reduce the amount of space a database consumes and ensure that data is logically stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ensuring data dependencies make sense (only storing related data in a table) means that data elements that are related or dependent on each other should be stored together in the same table or related tables. For example, in a database for a library, information about books, authors, and borrowers should be organized in a way that reflects how these entities are connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Database normalization is the process of restructuring a relational database in accordance with a series of so-called ***normal forms*** in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Normal Forms\n",
    "\n",
    "The database community has developed a series of guidelines for ensuring that databases are normalized. These are referred to as ***normal forms and are numbered from one (the lowest form of normalization, referred to as first normal form or 1NF) through five (fifth normal form or 5NF)***. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practical applications, normalization achieves its best in 3rd Normal Form.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1NF (First Normal Form) Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- A table should only have a single value in each column, not a collection of values or a list of values. This is know as Atomicity rule.\n",
    "***Atomicity rule*** means that you can only have one single instance value of the column attribute in any cell of the table. In simple terms, a single cell cannot hold multiple values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Values stored in a column should be of the same domain.(columns hold values of the same datatype)\n",
    "\n",
    "- All the columns in a table should have unique names.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rows must be uniquely identified (Tables must have a primary key)\n",
    "\n",
    "- And the order in which data is stored should not matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2NF (Second Normal Form) Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Functional dependency*** refers to the relationship between two attributes in a table where one set (the determinant) determines the values of the other set (the dependent) , typically the primary key and additional non-key attributes.\n",
    "For example, in a database of employees, the employee ID number (determinant) would determine the employee’s name, address, and other personal information (dependent).\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Partial dependency*** refers to a situation in which a non-key attribute in a relational database table depends only on part of the ***composite key***.\n",
    "A composite key is a key that consists of a combination of two or more attributes (columns) that, when taken together, uniquely identify a row in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first condition for the table to be in Second Normal Form is that the table has to be in First Normal Form. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Second Normal Form is about how a table’s non-key columns( non-key attributes ) relate to the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The table also should not contain partial dependency. This means that each non-key attribute in the table must be dependent on the entire primary key.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The first condition for the table to be in Third Normal Form is that the table should be in the Second Normal Form.\n",

    "- No Transitive Dependency\n",

    "Player_Rating is dependent on Player ID  too, but only indirectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dependency of this kind is called a transitive  dependency.\n",

    "### Problems without Normalization in DBMS\n",
    "\n",
    "If a table is not properly normalized and has data redundancy(repetition) then it will not only eat up extra memory space but will also make it difficult for you to handle and update the data in the database, without losing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Insertion, Updation, and Deletion Anomalies*** are very frequent if the database is not normalized.\n",

    "1. Insert Anomaly : \n",
    "\n",
    "An insert anomaly happens when we try to insert a record into this table without knowing all the data we need to know. \n",
    "For example, if we wanted to add a new student but did not know their course name or fees paid.We would be adding incomplete data to our table, which can cause issues when trying to analyse this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Update Anomaly :\n",
    "\n",
    "An update anomaly happens when we want to update data, and we update some of the data but not other data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let’s say the class Biology 1 was changed to “Intro to Biology”. We would have to query all of the columns that could have this Class field and rename each one that was found.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s a risk that we miss out on a value, which would cause issues.\n",
