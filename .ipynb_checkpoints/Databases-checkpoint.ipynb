    "What is data?\n",
    "\n",
    "In basic terms, data is facts and figures about anything. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if data were collected on a person, then that data might include their \n",
    "\n",
    "- name, \n",
    "- age,\n",
    "- email, and \n",
    "- date of birth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Or the data could be facts and figures related to an online purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could be the \n",
    "\n",
    "- order number, \n",
    "- description, \n",
    "- order quantity,\n",
    "- date, and\n",
    "- the customer's email. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data is crucial for individuals as well as organizations. \n",
    "Where's all this data stored? In our digital world, data is no longer stored in manual files. Instead, developers use something called databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "***A database is a form of electronic storage in which data is organized systematically. It stores and manipulates data electronically to make it more manageable, efficient, and secure.*** \n",
    "\n",
    "To give an idea of databases in a real world context, let's briefly describe some typical use cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- your bank uses a database to store data for customers, bank accounts and transactions, \n",
    "- hospital stores, patient data staff data, laboratory data and more. \n",
    "- And an online store retains your profile information along with your shopping history and accounting transactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What’s the difference between a database and a spreadsheet?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spreadsheets were originally designed for one user, and their characteristics reflect that. They’re great for a single user or small number of users who don’t need to do a lot of incredibly complicated data manipulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Databases are designed to hold much larger collections of organized information—massive amounts, sometimes. Databases allow multiple users at the same time to quickly and securely access and query(request) the data using highly complex logic and language."

    "## How is data related?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take at this scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You're managing the database of a large online store.\n",
    "- Your database must be able to retrieve ***the customer's details*** from one table and then find the ***order recorded*** against another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "***How does the database establish a relationship between these pieces of data? (i.e the customer's details and the order recorded)***\n",
    "\n",
    "Data stored in a database cannot exist in isolation. It must have a relationship with other data so that it can be processed into meaningful information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore how data is related by using the online store as our example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"img/relateddata.png\"\n",
    "     height= \"400px\"\n",
    "width= \"720px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "To locate the details of a customer's order, you will check the order number against the customer ID. In other words, the database establishes a link between the data in the tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the customer table in more detail. In this table, the columns are Customer ID, FirstName, LastName, and Email. In relational database terms, these are fields. Then there are several rows which contain data for each of these fields. In relational databases, they're known as records of the table. All these fields and rows work together to store information on the customer, also known as the entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's most important is that each of these customer instances or records must be uniquely identifiable. ***But what if two or more customers share similar info, like the same first name or last name.*** To avoid this confusion within the database, you can use a field that contains only unique values like the customer ID. This is called a ***primary key field***. It contains unique values that cannot be replicated elsewhere in the table. Even if two customers share the same name, they'll still have separate customer IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding the customer ID field to the order table, our relationship is established between the customer table and the order table. Because of this relationship, you can pull data in a meaningful way from both tables. ****The customer ID field in the order table is known as the foreign key field.*** A foreign key is a field in one table that connects to the primary key field in the original table, which in this case is the customer table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The customer ID is the primary key of the customer table, but it becomes a foreign key in the order table. This way, the relationship is established and the data in these two tables are related. "

    "A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a way of structuring information in tables, rows, and columns. An RDB has the ability to establish links—or relationships–between information by joining tables, which makes it easy to understand and gain insights about the relationship between various data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "***The reason we refer to them as “relational” databases is because data in one table can be “related” to data in another table.\n",
    "This simply allows any table to be related to another table using a common attribute.***\n",

    "Example of this is the large online store scenario prviously stated above.\n",
