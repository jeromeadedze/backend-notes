    "A Python virtual environment (venv) is simply a directory with a particular file structure. It has a bin subdirectory that includes links to a Python interpreter as well as subdirectories that hold packages installed in the specific venv.\n",

    "In simple terms it is an isolated environment having its copy of the python interpreter and libraries so that there’s no clash with the global installation of Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Isolated Environment: A virtual environment allows you to create a self-contained workspace where you can install and manage specific versions of Python packages without affecting the global Python environment or other projects on your system. It provides a dedicated space for your project to operate in.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Copy of the Interpreter: When you create a virtual environment, it includes a copy of the Python interpreter specific to that environment. This means that any modifications or configurations made to the interpreter within the virtual environment will not impact the global Python interpreter or other projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Libraries and Packages: The virtual environment also includes its own copy of the Python libraries and packages. When you install or update packages within the virtual environment, they are separate from the global Python installation. This allows you to have different versions of packages for different projects, avoiding conflicts between dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No Clash with Global Installation: By having a separate virtual environment, you can avoid clashes or conflicts between packages or libraries used by different projects. This is especially useful when different projects require different versions of the same package, as you can set up separate virtual environments for each project to maintain compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***The global Python environment*** refers to the installation of Python and its associated packages that are available system-wide. It is the default Python environment that is accessible to all projects and applications on your system. By using a virtual environment, any modifications or installations made within that environment do not alter or impact the global Python environment.\n",

    "- Now after creating an app, lets say I want to display some text when a user visits the applications homepage.\n",
    "- To do this, I need to work with Django files called `views.py` and `urls.py`.   \n",
    "- In Django, when a user navigates to a URL,***(menaing the user has entered or clicked on a specific web address (URL) in the browser's address bar or through a hyperlink)***\n",
    "- The URL is directed to something called a `view` \n",
    "- Just think of ***views as Python functions that generate the content that makes up the webpage.*** They can receive a request and return a response. Because this request and response will take place over the web, it'll use two objects called ***HTTP request and HTTP response.*** \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's create a view function and see how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open the `views.py` file in the app's folder\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"img/views.png\"\n",
    "     height= \"400px\"\n",
    "width= \"720px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's important to know that just creating a view function that returns an HTTP response will not do anything on its own if the user attempt to visit the app page. This is just the logic that will be executed when a user goes to the app's page. \n",
    "\n",
    "- To make this work, we need to map the ***view function to a URL.*** \n",
    "\n",
    "- The URL you will use in your Django project are stored in a file called `URLs.py`, which is located in the project directory. This file contains a list data structure called ***urlpatterns*** that holds a list of paths \n",
    "\n",
    "- The ***urlpatterns*** acts like a mapping chart the Django uses to determine which view functions are associated with a specific URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the `urls.py` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"img/urlspy.png\"\n",
    "     height= \"400px\"\n",
    "width= \"720px\">\n",
    "\n"
