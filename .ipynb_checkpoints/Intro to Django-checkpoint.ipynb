    "# What is Django\n",
    "\n",
    "Django is an open source web development framework written in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "The term ***framework*** can refer to a ***structure***. It could be the structure of a system, a building, a project, or anything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "A software framework is a platform that provides a foundation for developing software applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "It helps provide the required guide to speed up your development process and accomplish your goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Let’s say you’re building a house. You could pour the foundation and frame the house yourself. It would take a lot of time, but you could do it. If all of that were already done for you, though, it would save you quite a bit of effort — especially if it was done by expert home builders.\n",
    "In software development, a framework serves a similar purpose. It’s designed and tested by other Software Developers and Engineers, so you know it’s a solid foundation.\n",
    "A house isn’t complete with just the framework, though. Similarly, a framework in software development is a starting point, but you add higher-level functionality to it to make it work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Types of Software Frameworks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Web Application Frameworks : ***Django*** , Ruby on Rails\n",
    "2. Frontend Frameworks : React, Bootstrap\n",
    "3. DataScience Frameworks : Apache Spark, PyTorch\n",
    "4. Mobile Development Frameworks : Flutter\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "### The purpose of a web framework is to :\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make application development easier and to provide the developer with a ***clean structure*** that keeps things in order and allows for changes and modifications. ***(Saving software developers time and energy)***\n",
    "- Frameworks also allow for code reusability facilitated by existing code. \n",
    "- Allow coders to focus on tasks more specific to their project\n",
    "\n",
    "> It's a good idea to use a software framework rather than re-inventing the wheel from scratch for numerous reasons. And perhaps the most important reason is that you won't have to write everything from scratch. This reduces the possibility of adding errors to your code.\n",

    "## Vitual Envronment\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python ***virtual environment*** (venv) is simply a directory with a particular file structure. It has a bin subdirectory that includes links to a Python interpreter as well as subdirectories that hold packages installed in the venv directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms it is an isolated environment having its copy of the python interpreter and libraries so that there’s no clash with the global installation of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Isolated Environment: A virtual environment allows you to create a self-contained workspace where you can install and manage specific versions of Python packages without affecting the global Python environment or other projects on your system. It provides a dedicated space for your project to operate in.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Copy of the Interpreter: When you create a virtual environment, it includes a copy of the Python interpreter specific to that environment. This means that any modifications or configurations made to the interpreter within the virtual environment will not impact the global Python interpreter or other projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Libraries and Packages: The virtual environment also includes its own copy of the Python libraries and packages. When you install or update packages within the virtual environment, they are separate from the global Python installation. This allows you to have different versions of packages for different projects, avoiding conflicts between dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No Clash with Global Installation: By having a separate virtual environment, you can avoid clashes or conflicts between packages or libraries used by different projects. This is especially useful when different projects require different versions of the same package, as you can set up separate virtual environments for each project to maintain compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***The global Python environment*** refers to the installation of Python and its associated packages that are available system-wide. It is the default Python environment that is accessible to all projects and applications on your system. By using a virtual environment, any modifications or installations made within that environment do not alter or impact the global Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vitual Envronment Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "- `virtualenv` is a third-party tool that allows you to create isolated Python environments. It is not installed by default with Python, but it can be installed using `pip`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `venv`* is a built-in module in Python 3.3 and later versions that allows you to create isolated Python environments. It creates a folder which contains all the necessary executables to use the packages that a Python project would need.\n",
