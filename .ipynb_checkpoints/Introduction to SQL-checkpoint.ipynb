    "## SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data engineer, you can interact with databases using Structured Query Language(SQL).\n",
    "\n",
    "What sort of interactions do database engineers need to establish with databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are operations/interactions you could carry it in a database that might require you to create, read, update, and delete data. \n",
    "These operations are also known as CRUD operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL is the standard language that can be used with all databases. It's particularly useful when working with relational databases, which require a language that can interact with structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of relational databases that SQL can interact with include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. \n",
    "\n",
    "How does a database interpret or read and execute instructions given using SQL? \n",
    "- It does this with the use of a Database Management System or DBMS.\n",
    "- The DBMS takes responsibility for transforming SQL instructions into a form that's understood by the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you've just been hired to create a database for a business. First, you need to create tables to hold data in all aspects of the business. Then you need to insert data into these tables and then modify this data whenever something changes. \n",
    "That's a lot of work but it's all possible and simple with the use of SQL and CRUD operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we make changes in a database when we need to?\n",
    "We do this with the help of CRUD operations. ***This stands for create, read, update, and delete.*** (Or in operational terms, create, add or insert data, read data, update existing data and delete data alongside these operations.) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Structured Query Language(SQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside CRUD, there are many other things SQL can do. They include\n",
    "\n",
    "- DDL (data definition language) - provides commands for defining, deleting and modifying tables in a database. Use the following commands in this category.\n",
    "\n",
    "- DML (data manipulation language) - provides the ability to query, delete and update data in the database.  Use the following commands in this category.\n",
    "\n",
    "- DQL (data query language) - lets you retrieve data from one or multiple tables letting you specify the data fields that you want based on preferred filter criteria \n",
    "\n",
    "- DCL (data control language) - deals with the rights and permissions of users of a database system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a closer look at these languages and their commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DDL \n",
    "- DDL Create command - Used to create storage objects in a database (like tables)\n",
    "<img src = \"img/ddl.png\"\n",
    "     height= \"400px\"\n",
    "width= \"720px\">\n",
    "- DDL Alter command - Moodify the structure of a table object in a database\n",
    "- DDL Drop command - Remove existing object from a database\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DML \n",
    "- DML Insert command - Insert records of data into a database table\n",
    "- DML Update command - Edit data that already exists in a database table.\n",
    "- DML Delete command - Delete one or more rows of data from a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DCL - controls access to the database\n",
    "- DCL Grant command\n",
    "- DCL Revoke command\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of SQL\n",
    "- requires very little coding skills to use (just a set of keywords)\n",
    "- Compatible with all relational databases like MySQL.\n",
    "- It is a portable language. Can then be used in any hardware, on any operating system or platform wherever you need. "
