    "As a data engineer, you can interact with databases using Structured Query Language(SQL).\n",
    "\n",
    "What sort of interactions do database engineers need to establish with databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are operations/interactions you could carry it in a database that might require you to create, read, update, and delete data. \n",
    "These operations are also known as CRUD operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL is the standard language that can be used with all databases. It's particularly useful when working with relational databases, which require a language that can interact with structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of relational databases that SQL can interact with include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. \n",
    "\n",
    "How does a database interpret or read and execute instructions given using SQL? \n",
    "- It does this with the use of a Database Management System or DBMS.\n",
    "- The DBMS takes responsibility for transforming SQL instructions into a form that's understood by the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you've just been hired to create a database for a business. First, you need to create tables to hold data in all aspects of the business. Then you need to insert data into these tables and then modify this data whenever something changes. \n",
    "That's a lot of work but it's all possible and simple with the use of SQL and CRUD operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we make changes in a database when we need to?\n",
    "We do this with the help of CRUD operations. ***This stands for create, read, update, and delete.*** (Or in operational terms, create, add or insert data, read data, update existing data and delete data alongside these operations.) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Category of Structured Query Language(SQL) Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "- DDL (data definition language) - provides commands for defining, deleting and modifying tables in a database. Use the following commands in this category.\n",
    "\n",
    "- DML (data manipulation language) - provides the ability to query, delete and update data in the database.  Use the following commands in this category.\n",
    "\n",
    "- DQL (data query language) - lets you retrieve data from one or multiple tables letting you specify the data fields that you want based on preferred filter criteria \n",
    "\n",
    "- DCL (data control language) - deals with the rights and permissions of users of a database system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a closer look at these languages and their commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DDL \n",
    "- DDL Create command - Used to create storage objects in a database (like tables)\n",
    "<img src = \"img/ddl.png\"\n",
    "     height= \"400px\"\n",
    "width= \"720px\">\n",
    "- DDL Alter command - Moodify the structure of a table object in a database\n",
    "- DDL Drop command - Remove existing object from a database\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DML \n",
    "- DML Insert command - Insert records of data into a database table\n",
    "- DML Update command - Edit data that already exists in a database table.\n",
    "- DML Delete command - Delete one or more rows of data from a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DCL - controls access to the database\n",
    "- DCL Grant command\n",
    "- DCL Revoke command\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of SQL\n",
    "- requires very little coding skills to use (just a set of keywords)\n",
    "- Compatible with all relational databases like MySQL.\n",
    "- It is a portable language. Can then be used in any hardware, on any operating system or platform wherever you need. "

    "## Tables in databases\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A table is the most basic type of database object in relational databases. \n",
    "- It is responsible for storing data in the database. \n",
    "- Like any other table, a database table also consists of rows and columns.\n",
    "- Rows represent each record.\n",
    "- Columns are like the definition of each field. Each column has a name that describes the data that is stored in it. Examples of column names could include FirstName, ProductID, and Price.\n",
    "- Where the row intersects with a column is where a cell is located. A cell is where you store an item of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every column in a table has a data type. \n",
    "- These data types are defined by SQL\n",
    "- ***The data type of a column defines what type of value a column can hold like integer, character, date and time.***\n",
    "It's up to the developer to decide the data type for each column. \n",
    "\n",
    ">***Data types in SQL serve as a guideline or instruction for SQL on how to handle and interact with the data stored in a database.***\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here are some of the data types that are available:\n",
    "- Numeric data types such as INT and FLOAT \n",
    "- Date and time data types such as DATE, TIME, and DATETIME. \n",
    "- Character and string data types such as CHAR, and VARCHAR. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tables in a relational database\n",
    "\n",
    "- In relational database terminology a table is also known as a ***relation. ***\n",
    "- A table row or a record is also known as a ***tuple***.\n",
    "- Each table or relation in a database has its own schema. Schema simply means the structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "The structure includes:\n",
    "the name of the table or relation,  \n",
    "its attributes,  \n",
    "their names  \n",
    "and data type. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key\n",
    "\n",
    "A key refers to an attribute/a set of attributes that help us identify a row (or tuple) uniquely in a table (or relation).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a primary key?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a table, there is a field or column that is known as a key which can uniquely identify a particular tuple (row) in a relation (table). This key is specifically known as a primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the student table, the student ID allows you to uniquely identify a particular row. The other columns like first name, last name, date of birth and others could contain duplicate or repeating data for multiple students. Therefore, they can't be used to uniquely identify a given student record. So, the student ID is the primary key of the student table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a foreign key?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tables in a relational database need to have relationships/a link between them. \n",
    "- Tables are linked with one another through a key column (the primary key) of one table that’s also present in the related table as a ***foreign key***.\n",
    "- A foreign key is a field in one table that refers to a common field in another table (usually the primary key). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the student table and the department table are linked via the student ID which is the primary key of the student table that’s also present in the Department table as a foreign key.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"img/foreignkey.png\"\n",
    "     height= \"400px\"\n",
    "width= \"720px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of keys (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Candidate Key: A unique identifier for a record in a table that could potentially be used as a primary key. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Composite Key: A combination of two or more columns used as a primary key. It is used when a single column is not sufficient to uniquely identify a record.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternate Key: A unique identifier for a record that is not the primary key. It can be used as a secondary way to look up data in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integrity constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Every table in a database should abide by rules or constraints. These are known as integrity constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main integrity constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Key constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "The key constraint specifies that there should be a column, or columns, in a table that can be used to fetch data for any row. This key attribute or primary key should never be NULL or the same for two different rows of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Domain constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Domain constraints refer to the rules defined for the values that can be stored for a certain column. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you cannot store the home address of a student in the first name column. Similarly, a contact number cannot exceed ten digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Referential integrity constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "When a table is related to another table via a foreign key column, then the referenced column value must exist in the other table. This means, according to the student and department examples, that values should exist in the student ID column in the student table because the two tables are related via the student ID column.\n",
    "\n",
    "(The values of the foreign key should simply exist)"

    "## Database Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of this reading is to learn more about tables, fields (or attributes), records, keys and table relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is database structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "Database structure refers to how data is arranged in a database. Within a database, related data are grouped into tables, each of which consists of rows (also called tuples) and columns, like in a spreadsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of a database consists of a set of key components. \n",
    "\n",
    "These include:      \n",
    "\n",
    "- Tables or entities, where the data is stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Attributes which are details about the table or entity. In other words, attributes describe the table.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Fields, which are columns used to capture attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A record, which is one row of details about a table or entity. \n",
    "\n",
    "- And the primary key, which is a unique value for an entity. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"img/databasetable.png\"\n",
    "     height= \"400px\"\n",
    "width= \"720px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Table\n",
    "\n",
    "A table contains all the fields, attributes and records for a type of entity. A database will most probably contain more than one table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "Column headings are known as fields. Each field contains a different attribute. For every table, a unit of data is entered into each field. Each column has a data type. For example, the “agent_name” column has a data type of text, and the “commission” column has a numeric data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Column value or unit of data\n",
    "\n",
    "Each individual piece of data entered into a column is a unit of data. These units are also called data elements or column values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Records\n",
    "\n",
    "A record consists of a collection of data for each entity. It’s also known as a row in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical database structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a visual representation of how the database will be implemented into tables during physical database design, using a Database Management System (DBMS) like MySQL or Oracle, for example. \n",
    "- The diagram is known as Entity Relationship Diagram \n",
    "\n",
    "Logical database structure also shows how relationships are established between entities.There can be three ways in which entity instances can be related to each other:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One-to-one relationships \n",
    "2. One-to-many relationships \n",
    "3. Many-to-many relationships \n",
