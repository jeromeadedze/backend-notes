    "Where's all this data stored? In our digital world, data is no longer stored in manual files. Instead, developers use something called databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "***A database is a form of electronic storage in which data is organized systematically. It stores and manipulates data electronically to make it more manageable, efficient, and secure.*** \n",

    "To give an idea of databases in a real world context, let's briefly describe some typical use cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- your bank uses a database to store data for customers, bank accounts and transactions, \n",
    "- hospital stores, patient data staff data, laboratory data and more. \n",
    "- And an online store retains your profile information along with your shopping history and accounting transactions. "
